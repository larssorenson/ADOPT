# Lágmark
Lágmark, Icelandic for "Minimum", is a set of utilities to help manage permissions in Azure DevOps.

The main functionality is retrospective insights. By reviewing previous access and use history, the tool will summarize who should have what permissions, then provide functionality to implement them.
The idea is to make it easy to automatically manage permissions at scale across large Azure DevOps deployments, whether it's several Organizations, Projects, or simply a large number of resources.
